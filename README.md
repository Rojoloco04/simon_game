This project was designed by using an AVR microcontroller in conjunction with some basic circuitry and firmware written in C to produce a replica of the popular game Simon.
LEDs and buttons were used such that a pattern would play on the LEDs and the player would have to mimic the pattern exactly in order to "win" the game.
